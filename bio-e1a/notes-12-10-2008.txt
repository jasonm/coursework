In euk, some genes are present in many, many copies, due to the need for high levels of product.
i.e. gene coding for machinery; histones, ribosomes, ...

Globins
a-globin, b-globin
myoglobin used in muscles
white meat / dark meat in e.g. birds is due to pigmentation, which is due to presence to myoglobin

Often, new variant of gene created by recombination mutation.

Pseudogenes - copies of genes that appear like another, but no longer function
transposition - Movement from one chromosome to another

Tandem Repeats
Transposable elements
LINE (long interspersed element)
SINE (short interspersed element)

Alu sequence (300bp) > 1M repeats -> 10% of human genome!

Consider B-globin as an example of what happens after transcription

UI = untranslated
ORF = open reading frame
poly-A tail has 100-200 A's on 3' end of molecule
"5' cap" is backwards guanosine
poly-A tail makes it stable

Spliceosome
Donor site follows exons
Acceptor site precedes introns
machinery splices donor site to acceptor site; the *next* sequential acceptor, since
this is happening at the same time as xscription (and the next acceptor is the first one available)

Sometimes you can trick the slicing machinery by covering an acceptor site with an RNA binding protein,
resulting in controlled 'alternative splicing.'

DNA/RNA/proten -> genome/transcriptome/proteome, with (in humans) 21K genes/100K mRNAs/1M proteins

TATA box is kind of like a promoter; it identifies xscription start point (more or less).

GTF - Generic Transcription Factor

Dimer binders: helix-turn-helix-dimer, zinc finger dimers, etc.
homodimer: same protein, 2x, adhere back-to-back
heterodimer: diff. proteins

often these will have 2 domains with a loose structure (has some wiggle room)
holding them together; DNA binding domain and activation domain.

Nuclesomes, chromatin

Histone tails are very rich in lysine (one such tail has 44 lysines!), which is typ. + charged, making histones
very attracted to DNA (and all the - charge of its phosphate).

Adding an acetyl group to lysine (done so by HATs; histone acetyl transferases) starts getting rid of the charges,
loosening up on the DNA, and allowing it to be xscribed.

Histones have codes.  We understand the acetylation best (vs methylation, ubiquination, etc.).  Reverse of HAT is
HDAC (histone deacetylases), turns gene off again.

Imprinting - genes that only function if inherited from the correct sex (since each sex methylates its gametes dna differently)
this is an example of epigenetic changes.
